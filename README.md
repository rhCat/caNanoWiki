# caNanoWiki_AI Web Application
This hobby project aims to provide a chatGPT powered digital assistant to help users look for answers in a Wiki. The project is inspired by the OpenAI cookbook  project, but realizing there are a lot of concepts to understand and infrastructures to make it work.

Authors are Rui He and Weina Ke. 

This is the backend of the caNanoLibrarian app, which is a LLM based natural language searching experience for a structure database.

We have the application on https://cananowikipda.azurewebsites.net/login, if you want to play with it, the passcode is caNanoWikiAI_DEMO_wkrh_51423923*. We have a limited budget for this project, please let us know if you want to continue explore it when the GPT complains about limit. Thanks.

Document of this repo was mostly generated by ChatGPT, enjoy!

This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The application is primarily used for answering queries with context, leveraging the capabilities of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication**: The application has a simple authentication system. A user must enter a passcode to access the main page of the application. If the passcode is correct, the user is authenticated and can access the application. The application also includes a timeout feature, where the user is automatically logged out after a certain period of inactivity or after a session duration.

2. **Query Processing**: The application allows users to input queries, which are then processed by the `embedding_qa.answer_query_with_context` function. This function uses a document dataframe and document embeddings (loaded from a pickle file) to provide context for the query.

3. **Interaction with GPT-3.5 Turbo**: The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses to user queries. The parameters for the model, such as temperature and max tokens, are defined in the application.

4. **Web Interface**: The application provides a web interface for users to interact with. This includes a login page, a logout function, and an index page where users can input queries and view responses.

5. **Configuration**: The application uses a configuration file (`gpt_local_config.cfg`) to set the OpenAI API key and other parameters.

The application is designed to be run on a local server, with the host set to '0.0.0.0' and the port set to 5000.

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the application and run the command `python app.py`. This will start the application on your local server.

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- Flask
- OpenAI
- Tiktoken
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Configparser
- Pickle

These can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install flask openai tiktoken numpy pandas configparser pickle
